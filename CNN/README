Params and Data

To obtain the cifar10 data, run get_data.sh or visit the cifar10
website and get the binary data. Then unzip all the files into
the current directory.

To get the params, unzip cifar10_parameters.zip from the Params
folder into the current directory.
Use npz2zip.py to convert the .npz file to .zip file (includes 54 binary weights value files)



Working environment:
Folder should include test_batch.bin(testing data, from cifar10), 54 binary weights files(arr_0 to arr_53), and BNN codes.

BinaryCNN, BinaryCNN_muti load data every time inferencing an image.
BinaryCNN_init_load, BinaryCNN_init_load_multi load data only in initialization step.
(initialization takes about 10s, then inference taks about 5-7s per image)
BinaryCNN_clean is a cleaned version of  BinaryCNN_init_load_multi.

binary_net.py and cifar10.py is the py code for generate BNN model.
cifar10_inference.py is py code for testing the BNN model. (unable to work with all 10000 testing images together on some machines with limited memroy, maybe 1000 is ok)

binary_ops.py
get_data.sh is for downloading the cifar10
loadModel.py
